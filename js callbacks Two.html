    <!-- 
        Javascript is an event driven language.This means that instead of waiting for a response before moving on,
                JavaScript will keep executing while listening for othe events 
            Note: Javascript is synchronous and sigle-threaded language means it will execute one thread at
                  a time one by one .. in top-down method -->
    <!-- Callback function give JS asynchronity -->
    <!-- We will see how callback are used in Javascript as a asynchronous process   -->

    <script>
        setTimeout(function () {     // this function here is a callback function in setTimeout function and will be called afyer 5 sec  
            console.log("timer");
        }, 5000);                    // it will print "timer" after 5 second
        function x(y) {
            console.log("X");
            y();
        }
        x(function y() {             // when we call this x function we are passing another function y in it so 'y' is callback function here
            console.log("y");
        });

        // Output
        //x
        //y
        //timer


        // so How will our output be printed 
        // 1. settimeout function will be called and o/p will be stored in saperate place and will be printed after 5 second
        // 2. it will move to the next function in the meantime which is function x which will again call x written down
        // 3. in x function call it will pass a callback function y where it will do console.log x and x will be printed first. and then y.
        // 4. after 5 second "timer will be printed"


        //Example 2.
        const perOne = (friend, callbackfriend) => {
            console.log(`I am busy talking to ${friend}. I'll talk to you later`);
            callbackfriend();
        }
        const perTwo=()=>{
            console.log("Hey what's up");
        }
        perOne("Dilshad",perTwo);
        
        // Output
        // I am busy talking to Dilshad.I'll talk to you later
        // Hey what's up 
    </script>
